# University Portal

The aim of this project was to develop a university portal. The final users to which this simple application is addressed are:
- Teachers: in this application they can manage the grades the exams of the courses they teach. In particular they can:
  - Upload new grades;
  - Change grades if still possible;
  - Public grades in order to make them visible to students;
  - Verbalize grades.
- Students: they can visualize and manage their grades. In particular they can:
  - Visulize the grade receive if already published, otherwise a message will be delivered;
  - Refute the grade if not already verbalize.

This simple application has been developed in two versions:
- Pure HTML
- JavaScript

This has been done in order to compare the same fucntionalities, both client-side and server-side, with a pure HTML approach and a Rich Internet Application approach.

In this repository, you can find the implementation of both the approaches, the SQL scripts used to populate the database and a presentation (in Italian) containing an E-R diagram of the database and sequence diagrams of the application.
